# Employee-Attrition-Mini-Project


# Overview:

Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time. This means that employees are leaving faster than they are hired. Employee attrition happens when employees retire, resign, or simply aren't replaced. Although employee attrition can be company-wide, it may also be confined to specific parts of a business.

Employee attrition can happen for several reasons. These include unhappiness about employee benefits or the pay structure, a lack of employee development opportunities, and even poor conditions in the workplace. This project will help you predict employee attrition.
